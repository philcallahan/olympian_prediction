# olympian_prediction
As a high jumper in high school, I was always interested in what my chances of success would have been had I stuck with it, given my body type. From Kaggle.com, a dataset was found containing information on historical data for each Olympian from the last hundred years.
The goal of this project was to establish initial models that would predict the probability of an Olympian to earn a medal while competing in the Olympics (i.e., gold, silver, or bronze), given the available predictors. Once satisfied with the initial models’ accuracy, I was curious how they would perform when applied to different sports, for example, sports that were possibly less correlated with height, like swimming.

NOTE: This project’s original strategy was to separate Olympian populations by the two chosen sports/events high jump and swimming, then further separate by sex and establish two predictive models for each of the four groupings. Unexpectedly, during data exploration, it was discovered that certain variables were weighted differently depending on sex. For example, Age was more significant for females and Height more significant for males in high jump. This interesting finding would interject a more complicated analysis than originally planned for, at this point it was decided to focus on only male Olympians from both sports for this project.
